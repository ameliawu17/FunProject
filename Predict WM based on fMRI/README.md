Predicting individual responses in working memory tasks based on resting-state functional connectivity
===
Introduction
---
* Brain regions activated during cognitive tasks are functionally connected - functional networks
  * can be examined during task state to understand human behaviors
* Resting-state functional network - task-independent intrinsic pattern 
  * identify individuals within and across states 
  *
