Predicting individual responses in working memory tasks based on resting-state functional connectivity
===
Problem Statement
---
* Brain regions activated during cognitive tasks are functionally connected - functional networks
  * can be examined during task state to understand human behaviors
* Resting-state functional network - task-independent intrinsic pattern 
  * identify individuals within and across states 

* What is the correlation in time series between pairs of parcels like across the whole brain under resting state?
* Does within-network functional connectivity during resting state predict individual variance in working memory task performance?

* Hypothesis:
  * Resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode network, frontoparietal network and the somatomotor network relate to working memory performance

Data discrption

This analysis is based on a population of healthy human data from [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/), which has collected fMRI (Functional magnetic resonance imaging) time series data from both resting state and as well as 7 task conditions. fMRI measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow which allows us to better understand how coordinated activity across the whole brain adjusts to produce behaviorally appropriate responses to environmental changes.
