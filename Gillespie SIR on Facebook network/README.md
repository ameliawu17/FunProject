The modeling of a stochastic SIR dynamics on Facebook social network using Gillespieâ€™s algorithm
===
Introduction
---


* The Gillespie Algorithm is a stochastic simulation algorithm for simulating the changes in the molecular populations of chemical species in a chemically reacting system.
* The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is one of the most frequently studied epidemic processes in complex networks.

* The Facebook network data which consists of 'circles' (or 'friends lists') from Facebook. Facebook data was collected from survey participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks. It can be found at [here](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html)  
    * Number of nodes(N) : 4,039; 
    * Number of edges(M) : 88,234; 
    * Mean degree $<k>$ :  43.6910; 
    * The hand shaking lemma is ![1](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\sum_{i=1}^{N}k_i=2M) ; 
    * Average degree of a neighbor ![2](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\frac{<k^2>}{<k>}=635)
