The modeling of a stochastic SIR dynamics on Facebook social network using Gillespieâ€™s algorithm
===
Introduction
---
* The Gillespie Algorithm is a stochastic simulation algorithm for simulating the changes in the molecular populations of chemical species in a chemically reacting system.
* The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is one of the most frequently studied epidemic processes in complex networks.
